<h1 >Threats to Biodiversity</h1>
<h2 class="heading">6 Main Threats to Biodiversity</h2>
<h3>&bull; Climate Change</h3>
<p class="info">As climate warms, species will migrate towards higher latitudes and altitudes in both hemisphere. The increase in the amount of CO2 in the air affects the physiological functioning of plant and species composition. Moreover, aquatic ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, mangrove swamps, and coastal wetlands, are vulnerable to changes in climate.</p>
<h3>&bull; Habitat Loss and Degradation</h3>
<p class="info">Habitat loss may either be caused by natural events like natural events like natural calamities or geological events or anthropogenic activities like deforestation and man induced  climate change.</p>
<h3> &bull; Pollution</h3>
<p class="info">Be it water, air or land pollution, all forms of pollutions appear to be a threat to all life forms on earth. </p>
<h3>&bull; Invasive Species</h3>
<p class="info">An exotic and unnatural sppecies can be any kind of organism that has been introduced to a foreign habitat. This introduction can cause major threats to the native species. </p>
<h3>&bull; Overexploitation</h3>
<p class="info">It refers to the act of over-harvesting species and natural resources at rates faster than they can actually sustain themselves in the wild. </p>
<h3>&bull; Other potential threats</h3>
<P class="info">Epidemics and infectious diseases of wildlife such as Ebola virus, infectious bursal disease, and flu affect wildlife and biodiversity</P>
<h2 class="heading">Human activities which are threat to Biodiversity</h2>
<h3>&bull;Poaching</h3>
<p class="info">Poaching has been defined as the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals, usually associated with land use rights. Poaching was once performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets.But nowadays thousands of animals are being slaughtered for their rare animal products such as ivory, fur, organs, skin, bones, or teeth, which is leading to their extinction in the near future.</p>

<h3>&bull;Deforestation</h3>
<p class="info">Deforestation or forest clearance is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests at present. This represents a one-third loss from the existing forest cover before the expansion of agriculture, a half of that loss ocurring in the last century. Between 15 million to 18 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Belgium, are destroyed every year, on average 2,400 trees are cut down each minute.</p>

<h3>&bull;Pollution</h3>
<p class="info">Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>
