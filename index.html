    <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
    
    <h2 class="heading" >What is Biodiversity</h2>
      <p class="info">Biodiversity is the biological variety and variability of life on Earth. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Terrestrial biodiversity is usually greater near the equator, which is the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth, and is richer in the tropics.These tropical forest ecosystems cover less than ten percent of earth's surface, and contain about ninety percent of the world's species. Marine biodiversity is usually higher along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans.[6] There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future as a primary result of deforestation. It encompasses the evolutionary, ecological, and cultural processes that sustain life.</p>
    <h2 class="heading" >Levels of Biodiversity</h2>
      <ol class="list" type="a">
        <li>Genetic Diversity</li>
        <p class="info">The variation among members of a single species because of genes is called genetic diversity. This type of diversity is seen in different population groups of a species or even among different members of a population. For example, different varieties of rice show genetic diversity. Similarly, differences in height, skin colour, facial features, hair colour, etc. among human beings show genetic diversity. A higher level of genetic diversity among members of a species ensures that the species is at lower risk of becoming extinct; because genetic diversity increases the ability to adapt to the environment. Genetic diversity is responsible for giving birth to a new variety of a species.</p>
       <li>Species Diversity</li>
        <p class="info">The total number of species of plants and animals in a given region is called species diversity of that region. Species diversity is considered as the most common meaning of biodiversity. This is taken as a unit of measurement for balance of any ecosystem. Population of microorganisms is impossible to count because they can be in millions or even billions in numbers. Only 10 gm of soil may contain a billion bacteria and more than 50,000 fungi. Hence, number of microorganisms is not counted while defining the biodiversity at a place.</p>
      <li>Ecological Diversity</li>
        <p class="info">The system of interaction among different creatures and between living beings and abiotic components in a region is called ecosystem. There are many types of ecosystem on earth, e.g. grasslands, mountains, desert, marshes, ocean, river valley, tropical forest, etc. Each ecosystem has its unique geographical and environmental features. Such features are responsible for diversity among creatures in a particular region. This type of diversity is called ecosystem diversity.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading" > Biodiversity Hotspots</h2>
    <p class="info">A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region that is both a significant reservoir of biodiversity and is threatened with destruction.
        The term biodiversity hotspot specifically refers to 25 biologically rich areas around the world that have lost at least 70 percent of their original habitat.</p>

        <h2 class="heading" >Values of Biodiversity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Environmental Value</li>
                <p class="info" >The environmental value of biodiversity can be found by examining each ecosystem process and identifying the ecosystem services that result.</p>
            <li>Social Value</li>
                <p class="info" >The social value of biodiversity includes aesthetic, recreational, cultural and spiritual values. To this can be added health benefits resulting from recreational and other activities.</p>    
            <li>Ethical Value</li>
                <p class="info" >It is based on the principle of 'live and let others live'. Ethical values related to biodiversity conservation are based on the importance of protecting all forms of life. All forms of life have the right to exist on earth.</p> 
          </ul>
